This is primarily from [hey grill hey](https://heygrillhey.com)'s recipes for [low slow smoked ribs](https://heygrillhey.com/low-and-slow-ribs-old-school-smoky-flavor/) and [sweet & spicy rub](https://heygrillhey.com/simple-grilled-pork-chops-with-secret-sweet-rub). There have been minor edits from those.

Ingredients
===========
- 1 rack St. Louis ribs
- 1 cup apple cider
- 2 tbsp salted butter (melted)
- "2 tbsp" rub (below) -- I needed to make a double-batch
- plain yellow mustard (optional)
- 1 cup BBQ sauce (optional)

Rub
---
- 2 tablespoon brown sugar
- 2 teaspoon kosher salt
- 1 teaspoon cracked black pepper
- 1 teaspoon paprika
- ½ teaspoon ground mustard
- ½ teaspoon cayenne pepper

Preparation
===========
1. Start by rinsing your ribs under cold water and patting dry with a paper towel. Trim down any excess fat and remove the thin membrane on the back of the ribs.
2. Season liberally with the "secret" sweet rub and prepare your grill for indirect grilling.
  - (Optional) coat with plain yellow mustard to hold the rub
  - The target temperature on your grill is 225 degrees F. Use fruit woods like apple, peach, cherry, or hardwoods like hickory or oak.
3. In a small saucepan combine the butter and apple cider. Place on your grill alongside the ribs.
4. Close the lid and cook for an hour and a half without opening the lid.
5. Baste liberally with the apple cider mixture then close the lid.
6. Wait 1 hour then baste again. Base a total of 4 times -- it'll be 5½ hours of cooking when you're done with this part.
7. (Optional) Coat the ribs with desired BBQ sauce and return to the grill for an additional 30 minutes to set your sauce.
8. Remove from heat, wrap in foil and allow the ribs to rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving.
