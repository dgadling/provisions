# Hot Toddy

A warm drink, especially great when you're feeling under the weather. Inspired by The [Hawksmoor recipe](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2017/dec/08/christmas-cocktail-recipes-hawksmoor-hot-doddy-shaky-pete-gin-sherry). 


## Tips
* The ratios are key here.
* *Spirit Selection:* Use other spirits at your own risk, ratios may need to be tweaked.
 * *English Harbour 15:* A smooth finish, light tasting spirit
 * *Chivas 12:* A slightly more smokey drink.
 * *Pyrat Rum:* A sweeter drink.
 * *Redbreast 12:* A crime, but a deliciously smooth one. 
 * Add 5ml of *Chartreuse* to make this more medicinal tasting. You may want to trim off 5ml of spirits to balance this out.
* Tempering the mug helps a lot to make this feel more warming, melt the honey, and keep the drink itself warm.
* You can make a larger batch in a pot. Keep the heat very low to avoid burning off the alcohol / evaporating the water.
