# Scottish Butter Shortbread

While you can add to shortbread, I love the simplicity of this recipe.  I have taken the [King Arthur Shortbread Recipe](https://www.kingarthurflour.com/recipes/shortbread-recipe) and sized it for a 9x13" pan as well as changed the proportions.  More flour, less sugar makes the shortbread crisper and less sweet.

## Equipment
* 9x13" baking sheet
* Large bowl
* Rubber spatula
* Stand mixer with balloon whisk (Optional)

## Ingredients
* 450g (1lb / 4 sticks / 32 tbsp) salted butter at cool room temperature 
* 220g (½lb) confectioners' sugar (powdered sugar or icing sugar for non-Americans)
* 4 teaspoons vanilla extract
* ¼ teaspoon almond extract, optional, or the flavor of your choice
* 550g all-purpose flour

## Method
1. Preheat the oven to 300°F
2. Lightly grease 9x13" baking sheet
3. In a medium-sized bowl, beat together the butter, sugar, vanilla, and almond extract. Optional: cream the butter and sugar in a stand mixer first for smoother dough
4. Beat in the flour. The mixture may seem a little dry at first; keep beating till it comes together. If it absolutely won't come together, dribble in up to 1 tablespoon of water, until it does. This is a stiff dough.
5. Press the dough into the prepared pan, smoothing the surface with your fingers, or with a mini rolling pin.
6. Sprinkle some turbinado sugar on the shortbread before baking.
6. Use a fork to prick the dough all over; this allows any steam to escape, and prevents the shortbread from bubbling as it bakes. Prick the dough in a random pattern, but it looks nicer pricked with some kind of symmetry.
7. Bake for 35 minutes at 300°F.  The shortbread should still be a pale colour; up the temperature to 350°F and bake for a further 10 minutes or until golden brown.
7. Bake the shortbread until it's a light golden brown across the top surface, and a deeper golden brown around the edges, between 35 and 38 minutes.
