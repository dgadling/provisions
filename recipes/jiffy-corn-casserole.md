# Jiffy Corn Casserole

From [The food Charlatan](https://thefoodcharlatan.com/creamed-corn-casserole/)

# Ingredients
- ½ cup butter (1 stick)
- 1 (15 oz) can whole kernel corn, _drained_
- 1 (15 oz) can creamed corn, **not** drained
- 1 cup sour cream
- 3 tablespoons granulated sugar
- ½ tsp kosher salt
- 1 (8 oz) box jiffy corn muffin mix

# Procedure
**NOTE**: There's two ways of doing this: directly in a square pan, or in a bowl. Totally up to you. The recipe is essentially "mix everything together, then bake". It's not rocket surgery.

**NOTE**: Using an all-edges pan, if you have one, is great!

1. Preheat oven to 350°F
2. In an 8" x 8" or 9" x 9" glass pan add the butter and melt right in the pan (if metal, don't, obvs). Spread butter all around with a pastry brush or something.
3. Drain the whole kernels then add to the butter in the pan
4. Dump the creamed corn into the pan
5. Add the sour cream, sugar, salt, and box of Jiffy corn muffin mix
6. Stir until well combined, scrape down edges.
7. Bake for 35-40 minutes. The edges should be turning golden brown and pulling away from the sides. When you shake the pan, the center should not be jiggling more than the edges. You can also use the toothpick test, when a toothpick inserted in the center comes out with no wet batter, it’s done.
8. Let cool on a wire rack for a couple minutes before serving warm.
