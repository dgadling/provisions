# Ingredients
- 230 g Fresno chiles (“red Jalapeño”) with stems trimmed but green tops left on
- 150 g bell peppers (red/yellow) with stems trimmed flush to top of pepper
- 35 g (one small head, ~ 10 cloves) garlic
- 2 tablespoons brown sugar
- 1 tablespoon kosher salt
- ½ cup water
- ½ cup distilled white vinegar (you’ll need it much later)

This made ~ 5 ounces when pushed through a fine mesh strainer.

# Preparation
1. Medium/rough cut chiles and peppers into ¼" or ½" pieces
2. Peel garlic cloves and cut in half
3. Add everything to blender and blend until “smoothie” consistency
4. Transfer to a glass jar
5. Cover with tea towel/paper towel and secure with a rubber band or similar
6. Put somewhere you don’t mind smelling like hot sauce (a garage is ideal)

# Fermentation
1. Check back in 3 days for tiny fermentation bubbles
2. Stir approximately daily
3. Repeat for at least two more days (five days of fermentation)
   - Or until you stop getting new bubbles
   - **Or** you get bored and decide you want hot sauce

# Finishing
1. Pour fermented stuff back into blender and add ½ cup distilled white vinegar
2. Blend until completely smooth (1-3 minutes)
3. Pour into a fine mesh strainer over a medium sauce pan
4. Push mixture through strainer with a rubber spatula
5. When you think you've got it all pushed through:
   1. Grab anything flat and rigid (table knife, whatever)
   2. Run it along the bottom of the strainer to catch sauce that's stuck there
   3. Repeat this push-and-scrape process until you run out of patience (at least twice more)
6. Bring sauce to a boil and then simmer for 5-10 minutes or until it has the consistency you want.
   - **NOTE**: this sauce will thicken up even more once it cools
7. Let sauce cool for a while, maybe put the pot in the fridge if you have room
8. Bottle as appropriate and stick in the refrigerator, you’re done!

# Variations
All of these variants went through _roughly_ the above process, for varying amounts of time (due to laziness/schedules). **NOTE** that basically all of these came out to ~ 4 cups (2 pints/1 quart) of mash to ferment. Plan jars appropriately.

The [2019 varieties](firesauce-2019.md) have moved to their own place.
