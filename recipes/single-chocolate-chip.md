From Small Batch Bakes by Edd Kimber

# Ingredients _per cookie_
* 1 tbsp unsalted butter, melted then cooled
* 1 tbsp light brown sugar
* 1 tbsp regular sugar
* ½ tbsp whole milk / nut milk (I like Oatley)
* 3 tbsp AP flour
* "a pinch" baking powder
* "a pinch" baking soda
* "a pinch" salt
* 2 tbsp mixins (e.g. dark chocolate, dates, etc)

# Method
1. Preheat over to 320° F convection/fan
2. In a bowl mix butter, both sugars, and milk together
3. Add flour, baking soda, baking powder, salt and mix
4. Add mixins and finish mixing
5. Form into ball, put on sheet with parchment paper, bake for 15-16 minutes

**Optionally**: Put in the fridge for 30 min + then take out and bake. It will be slightly gooey in the middle.
