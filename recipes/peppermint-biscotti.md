# Ingredients (:milk_glass: :egg: :bread:)
- ¾ cup butter, room temp/softened **not** melted
- ¾ cup sugar
- 3 large eggs, room temp
- 2 teaspoons **pepper**mint extract
- 3 + ¼ cup (390g) all-purpose flour
- 1 tsp baking powder
- ¼ tsp salt
- 1 cup crushed **pepper**mint candies[^1]

# Directions
1. Preheat oven to 350F

## Dough prep (~ 10 minutes)
1. In a medium bowl combine: flour, baking powder, salt, peppermint candy. Set aside
2. In a large bowl, cream butter & sugar ; 5-7 minutes
3. Agg eggs, 1 at a time, beating well after each egg
4. Mix in extract
5. Gradually add the dry bowl, beating until blended. This will be a stiff dough!
    - **NOTE**: Make sure the candy is pretty evenly distributed!

## First bake (~ 50 minutes)
1. Divide dough in half on two pieces of parchment paper [^2]
2. With lightly floured hands, lightly roll into a log (~ 12" x 2½") and place on parchment paper, giving a few little pats to give it a flatter top.
3. Bake for ~25 minutes / until golden brown
4. Carefully (so the loaves don't break) move to wire racks and allow to cool ~ 15 minutes
5. With a bread knife, cut diagonally into ~ ½" wide slices, rolling to be cut-side down
6. Bake 6-7 minutes, flip pieces to other side, then bake another 6-7 minutes, until quite firm (they'll harden even more as they cool)
7. Move to wire racks to cool

[^1]: You want the candy pieces to be small (~ ¼" on the long side) and well mixed. Otherwise, when they melt, they become structural weak points. This can make working with the loaves after the first bake _tricky_.
[^2]: Since there can be hot candy (read: glue) on the bottom/sides of the loaves, things might get interesting with the parchment paper. I haven't tried it yet.
