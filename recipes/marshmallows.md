# Marshmallows
From [Gemma's Bigger Bolder Baking](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/marshmallow-recipe-3-flavors/)

# Ingredients
* 6 tsp / 2 Tbsp unflavored powder gelatin
* 1 cup (8 oz / 225 ml) warm water, divided in half (water _A_ and water _B_)
* 1½ cups (12 oz / 350 g) sugar
* 1 cup (10 oz / 283 g) light corn syrup
* ¼ tsp salt
* flavorings/colors of your choice & amounts
    * minimum 1-2 tsp vanilla extract
* _dusting powder_: ¼ cup corn starch + ¼ cup powdered sugar

# Procedure
1. Add gelatin and water _A_ to the bowl of a stand mixer. Using the whisk attachment **hand mix** to dissolve all the gelatin.
2. In a small saucepan combine water _B_, granulated sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Dissolve over low/medium heat until clear. Do ***NOT*** let it boil.
3. Clip candy thermometer to side of pan and cook until 240°F / "soft ball", 15-20 minutes-ish. Creep up on it using a simmer burner so you don't overshoot.
4. Immediately remove from heat.
5. Turn mixer on low speed and slowly pour syrup down the side of the bowl into the gelatin. Once all is added increase speed to high. Whip until very thick and the bottom of the bowl is lukewarm, 12-14 minutes. Don't let it cool down very much!
6. While whipping, prepare a pan:
    1. Combine _dusting powder_ in a small bowl.
    2. _Lightly_ grease a 8" x 8" (or 7" x 11") pan with flavorless oil. Sift sugar & cornstarch to completely coat the bottom & sides of the pan. Don't worry about clumps of excess, that's better than having it stick.Reserve the rest of the _dusting powder_.
    3. Lightly grease a spatula, because this stuff has the stick. You may need to re-grease part way through.
7. During ***the last minute of whipping*** add any flavorings/colors
8. When ready, work ***QUICKLY*** to scrape the mixture into the prepared pan, spreading evenly. Dust the top with the remaining sugar/cornstarch mixture to lightly cover, reserving the rest.
9. Allow marshmallows to sit uncovered 4+ hours (*up to* overnight). It needs air to form a skin.
10. Turn out of the pan onto a cutting board. Lightly grease your cutter of choice and cut however you like. 
    * **NOTE**: Wash and re-grease once the cutter has marshmallow stuck to it or you'll stop _cutting_ and start _pushing_, giving ugly edges.
11. Once cut lightly dust all sides with remaining _dusting powder_.
12. Store in an airtight container.
