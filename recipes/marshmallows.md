# Marshmallows
From [Gemma's Bigger Bolder Baking](https://www.biggerbolderbaking.com/marshmallow-recipe-3-flavors/)

# Ingredients
* 6 tsp / 2 Tbsp unflavored powder gelatin
* 1 cup (8 oz / 225 ml) warm water, divided in half (water _A_ and water _B_)
* 1½ cups (12 oz / 350 g) sugar
* 1 cup (10 oz / 283 g) light corn syrup
* ¼ tsp salt
* flavorings/colors of your choice & amounts
    * minimum 1-2 tsp vanilla extract

# Procedure
1. Add gelatin and water _A_ to the bowl of a stand mixer. Have the whisk attachment ready.
2. In a small saucepan combine water _B_, granulated sugar, corn syrup, and salt. Dissolve over medium heat. Do ***NOT*** let it boil
3. Clip candy thermometer to side of pan and cook until 240°F / "soft ball", 15-20 minutes-ish.
4. Immediately remove from heat
5. Turn mixer on low speed and slowly pour syrup down the side of the bowl into the gelatin. Once all is added increase speed to high. Whip until very thick and the bottom of the bowl is lukewarm, 12-14 minutes.
6. While whipping prepare a pan:
    1. Combine confectioners' sugar & cornstarch in a small bowl.
    2. Lightly grease a 8" x 8" (or 7" x 11") pan with flavorless oil. Sift sugar & cornstarch to completely coat the bottom & sides of the pan. Reserve the rest of the mixture.
    3. Grease a spatula, **and** your hands, because this stuff has the stick
7. During ***the last minute of whipping*** add any flavorings/colors
8. When ready, work ***QUICKLY*** to scrape the mixture into the prepared pan, spreading evenly. Dust the top with the remaining sugar/cornstarch mixture to lightly cover, reserving the rest.
9. Allow marshmallows to sit uncovered 4+ hours (*up to* overnight). They need the air to form a skin.
10. Turn out of the pan and let the **other** side get exposed for another 4 hours. [Ed: really?!?]
11. On a cutting board, oil your cutter of choice and cut however you like. Once cut lightly dust all sides with remaining sugar mixture.
12. Store in an airtight container.
