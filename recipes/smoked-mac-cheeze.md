- 9" x 11" pan or all-edges or something similar, greased one way or another
- Two burners
- One oven / smoker

# Method of Preparation
1. Start heating the oven-ish-thing to 400 F. If you're using a smoker get it going at 225 F.
2. Bake the bacon on a cookie sheet (or wire rack on cookie sheet) for 15-25 minutes or until quite crunchy
3. In a large pot par-cook boil the pasta according to the directions. Generally 8-10 minutes.
   1. You want it quite tough (al dente) still when you pull it out, it'll finish cooking later.
   2. Once it's done boiling rinse it with cold water until the pasta is cold to stop the cooking process.
4. With the pasta & bacon going you can do other things!
5. In a medium sauce pot on medium heat:
   1. Melt the butter
   2. Add the flour, mustard, salt, pepper, and paprika. Stir until well mixed
   3. Add the half & half and cook until thickened, about 8-10 minutes. It helps to use a whisk.
   4. **NOTE**: You can leave this at any point if you need, to pull the bacon and crumble it, just turn the heat down to low and don't dawdle
6. At some point pull the bacon out, soak up excess grease with a paper towel, and crumble.
   1. If you're not smoking, but regular baking, set the oven to 350 F.
7. Pour this sauce over the cheddar to melt, stir until smooth, add everything else
   1. **NOTE**: This is another place where you can pull the bacon and start crumbling it, this sauce can sit for a while.
8. Pour everything into the baking pan
9. Ready, set, bake!
   1. If traditionally baking, bake at 350 F for about an hour
   2. If smoking, smoke at 225 F for 2-3 hours
