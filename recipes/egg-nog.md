# Ingredients

- 6 eggs, separated
- ½ C (125 g ) granulated sugar / Erythritol **SEE NOTES**
- 1 Tbsp (15 g) white sugar (for later)
- 3 C (~ 700 mL) whole milk / oat milk
- 1 C (~ 235 mL) heavy cream / 118g silken tofu + 118g soy milk
- ½ C (~ 120 mL) alcohol (bourbon/dark rum/whiskey, a mix, whatever) **SEE NOTES**
- Christmas spices
  - 1 tsp (2.5 g) grated nutmeg (ideally freshly grated, but whatever works)
  - 1 tsp (5 mL) vanilla
  - 1 tsp (2.5 g) cinnamon
  - ½ tsp (1.3 g) ginger
  - ⅛ tsp (0.25 g) cloves

# Directions

1. Separate the eggs
2. Combine the yolks, sugar, milk, and cream in a pot
3. Cook on medium heat, whisking very frequently, until it reaches 170° - 180° F (76° - 82° C), then take off the heat. Use a candy thermometer if you have one!
4. Add alcohol and spices, whisk really well
5. Cool pot in a water bath if possible, whisking as you do
6. Pour into a pitcher/jar/whatever and refrigerate to continue cooling
7. Whisk egg whites to very soft peaks/foam, then add sugar until you get stiffer (not stiff!) peaks
8. Semi-gently whisk/add egg whites into the cooled nog
9. Allow to age as long as you can tolerate (at least 18 hrs)
10. Optionally add more freshly ground nutmeg when serving

## NOTES
This came out great but only ***after*** letting it chill overnight. It tasted a little funny after just a few hours.

The base mostly filled a 64 oz mason jar. I wasn't able to get all of the egg whites in.
Over time as the bubbles broke down it made a bit more room.
Whisk/mix the whites in aggressively if you really want to get them all in, but it's OK if you have some left over.

If you're going the dairy-free-lower-sugar route, keep the Erythritol weight the same as sugar since the sweeter oat milk will make up the difference.
If you're just going the lower-sugar route, well, good luck and let me know what you thought!

### Important alcohol note
We used 51.5% bourbon because it was what we had on hand. For our tastes this was just right - enough to know it's "adult" egg nog, while leaving room to add more if you want a heavier pour.

If you're using normal 35 to 40% rum/whisky go up to ¾ - ⅔ cup (150 - 175 mL), respectively.
