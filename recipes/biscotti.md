This is [King Arthur's American-Style Vanilla Biscotti](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/american-style-vanilla-biscotti-recipe)

# Ingredients
- 6 tbsp (85g) butter ((un)salt(ed) doesn't matter)
- ⅔ cup (131g) granulated sugar
- ½ tsp table salt
- 2-3 tsp vanilla extract
- ¼ tsp almond extract (**optional**)
- 1½ tsp baking powder
- 2 large eggs
- max 2 cups ***extras***, see selected quotes below
- 2 cups (240g) unbleached AP flour
- coarse sparkling / pearl sugar for sprinkling on top (**optional**)

# Procedure
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease or line with parchment one large (18" x 13") baking sheet
2. In a medium-sized bowl beat: butter, sugar, salt, vanilla, baking powder, and optional almond extract until the mixture is smooth and creamy
3. Beat in the eggs one at a time. The batter may look slightly curdled, but it's fine.
4. ***ADD IN EXTRAS IF YOU'RE GONNA***
5. On the low speed of your mixer add the flour, stirring until smooth. It's a sticky dough
6. Plop the dough on the baking sheet, divide it in half and shape into two 9.5" x 2" logs about 3/4" tall. Straighten the logs and smooth out the top and sides (a wet spatula or wet bowl scraper is good). Add optional sprinkling sugar and press in gently
7. Bake for 25 minutes and remove
8. Using a spray bottle of room-temp water lightly spritz the logs, getting the sides as well. This makes it easier to slice.
9. Reduce the oven to 325°F
10. Let cool for 5 minutes, then slice crosswise into 1/2" or 3/4" slices. Or slice diagonally for longer. Keep sliced edges perfectly vertical.
11. Set the biscotti on edge on the baking sheet. Return to oven and bake 25-30 minutes, until they feel very dry and are turning golden. They'll dry more as they cool.
12. Remove from oven and let them cool on a rack. Store airtight at room temp for _weeks_

# Selected quotes

> Add up to 2 cups nuts, dried fruit (dried, not fresh), or chips to the dough, along with the flour. Adjust the spice to suit the add-in, if desired; e.g., add 1 teaspoon cinnamon with 1 cup chopped dried apple and 1 cup diced pecans. Or substitute hazelnut, butter-rum, or your favorite flavor for the vanilla. A classic Italian anise biscotti is made with 1/2 teaspoon anise extract (or 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon anise oil, to taste), and 1 tablespoon fennel seeds.
