# American-style vanilla biscotti

# Ingredients
* 6 tbsp (85g) butter
* ⅔ cup (131g) granulated sugar
* ½ tsp table/Kosher salt
* 2 tsp vanilla extract
* 1½ tsp baking powder
* 2 large egg
* max 140g ***extras***
* 2 cups (240g) unbleached AP flour

# Procedure
1. Preheat oven to 350°F. Lightly grease or line with parchment one large (18" x 13") baking sheet
2. In a medium-sized bowl beat: butter, sugar, salt, vanilla, baking powder, and optional almond extract until the mixture is smooth and creamy
     * **NOTE**: For spread & flattening during baking, bring butter up to room temp. For less/zero spread, leaving the butter cold
4. Beat in the eggs one at a time. The batter may look slightly curdled, but it's fine.
5. ***ADD IN EXTRAS IF YOU'RE GONNA***
6. On the low speed of your mixer add the flour, then bring speed up stirring until smooth. It's a sticky dough.
7. Plop the dough on the baking sheet, divide it in half and shape into two 9½" x 2" logs about ¾" tall. Straighten the logs and smooth out the top and sides (a wet spatula or wet bowl scraper is good). **Add optional sprinkling sugar** and press in gently
8. Bake for 25 minutes and remove
9. Using a spray bottle of room-temp water lightly spritz the logs, getting the sides as well. This makes it easier to slice.
10. Reduce the oven to 325°F
11. Let cool for 5 minutes, then slice crosswise into ½" or ¾" slices. Or slice diagonally for longer. Keep sliced edges perfectly vertical.
12. Set the biscotti on edge on the baking sheet. Return to oven and bake 25-30 minutes, until they feel very dry and are turning golden. They'll firm up more more as they cool.
13. Remove from oven and let them cool on a rack. Store airtight at room temp for _weeks_

This is [King Arthur's American-Style Vanilla Biscotti](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/recipes/american-style-vanilla-biscotti-recipe)

> Add up to 2 cups nuts, dried fruit (dried, not fresh), or chips to the dough, along with the flour. Adjust the spice to suit the add-in, if desired; e.g., add 1 teaspoon cinnamon with 1 cup chopped dried apple and 1 cup diced pecans. Or substitute hazelnut, butter-rum, or your favorite flavor for the vanilla. A classic Italian anise biscotti is made with 1/2 teaspoon anise extract (or 1/8 to 1/4 teaspoon anise oil, to taste), and 1 tablespoon fennel seeds.
