# Equipment
* At least a 9x9" baking dish, oiled. Preferrably metal, but glass is fine.
  * Alternatively, 9 jumbo muffin tins, or something similar
* Stand mixer with dough hook & paddle attachment
* Medium mixing bowl
* Large oiled bowl for dough proofing

# Ingredients
## For the dough
### Drys
* 420g all purpose flour
* 50g granulated sugar
* 50g light brown sugar
* 1 tsp salt
* 1 package (2 ¼ tsp) instant yeast
* 1 tsp cinnamon (Vietnamese, ideally)
* ½ tsp nutmeg
### Wets
* 120 mL (½ cup) **whole** milk
* 1 tsp vanilla extract
* 120g (½ cup) sour cream
* 85g (6 tbsp) **unsalted** butter
### While mixing
* 1 large (jumbo, ideally) egg

## For the filling (a double batch is fun)
* 57 (4 tbsp) softened **unsalted** butter
* 3 tbsp granulated sugar
* 2 tbsp brown sugar (use dark/light/mix as you see fit)
* 2 tbsp cinnamon (Vietnamese, ideally)
* ¼ tsp vanilla

## For the icing
* 1 cup confectioners' / powdered sugar
* 2-3 tablespoons water, milk, or heavy cream
* ½ tsp vanilla extract

# Instructions
## Dough assembly (~20 minutes) + first proof (~3 hours)
1. Put the drys in the bowl of a stand mixer. Whisk together then set aside.
2. Put the wets in a separate bowl. Microwave until warm to the touch (~ 110F) and stir until butter is melted.
3. Attach a dough hook to the mixer and pour the wets into the drys, then mix on low. Drop the egg in the mix and continue mixing until the dough _just_ comes together.
4. Turn the speed up to medium and continue mixing for another 6-10 minutes. You're done when the dough starts coming off the bottom of the bowl and climbing up the dough hook.
5. Dump the dough onto a clean (**un**floured) surface, and shape to create tension. Put into the large oiled bowl and lightly cover. Allow to rise in a warm place for 2.5 - 3 hours.

## Roll forming (~20 minutes) + final rise (~40 minutes / 1.5 - 2 hours)
1. Using the paddle attachment, mix all the filling ingredients together and cream until well combined and spreadable.
2. Drop the dough on a well-floured surface, make it rectangular-ish with your hands, then roll the dough out into a rectangle that's ¼" thick and wider when you face it.
3. Spread the filling on the dough, leaving a ~ 1" uncovered strip on the long side away from you. Roll up the dough tightly to get more layers, or loosely to get thicker layers. Let the log sit on the uncovered strip once you're doing so it joins the other dough.
4. Cut the dough into 9 pieces. Using thin string / unflavored dental floss is ideal (slide it under the roll, then cross the two ends to slice) but a sharp knife will work as well.
5. Place the rolls cut side up in the dish. Give them some room to grow, they shouldn't be touching yet
6. Choose your own adventure!
    1. Cover loosely and allow to rest in a warm place for 40 minutes, proceed to baking step.
    2. Cover **tightly** and place in the refigerator **overnight**. In the morning, remove and place in a warm area for 1.5 - 2 hours

## Finishing (~ 35 minutes, plus oven pre-heating time)
1. Heat oven to 350F and bake for 28-30 minutes or until nicely browned on top. If they're getting very brown at the 20 minute mark, cover them loosely with foil and continue to bake.
2. While baking, whisk together the vanilla icing ingredients and set aside.
3. Once done baking drizzle about half the icing over the rolls **immediately** after they're pulled from the oven. Add remaining icing once cooled, or individually when serving
