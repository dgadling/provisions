# Yorkies (Yorkshire Pudding)

Similar to a popover or a dutch baby, a bready side that's good with roasts or can be stuffed.

The BBC has more [good references](https://www.bbcgoodfood.com/howto/guide/top-tips-making-yorkshire-puddings)

## Tips

* The fat that you cook them in is key. Lard is good, Duck Fat is better.
* The pan and fat needs to be HOT when you pour the batter. It's basically the most important thing.
* The colder the batter is when you add it to the oil, the better.
* I use a muffin tin.
* You can rest the batter overnight for the best results.
* You can use a blender to make the batter.

## TODO Tweaks

* Try to get a bigger "drop" in the middle by opening the oven 5-10 minutes before they're done
* Does sifting the flour make a difference? How about a blender versus whisking?
* Vary fat load - is more better?
  * Too much ends up "weird" with fat pooling in the middle
* Try to add a dollop of jam after being added to pan and make breakfast yorkies.
  * This didn't work at all. The jam dripped through or exploded. Hard cleanup.
* Make a giant one in a cast-iron.
  * This worked really well. The amount of fat to use, or even how much batter to use is `¯\_(ツ)_/¯`

## Ingredients

> **_NOTE:_** This is designed to be scaled using eggs. 1 egg is ~ 1.25 yorkies, so 5 eggs gets you about 6 muffin tin sized yorkies.

> **_NOTE:_** 1 egg is not 1.25 yorkies when you use a [proper yorkie tin](https://www.amazon.com/WIN-WARE-Non-Stick-Yorkshire-yorkshire-puddings/dp/B00GFUHB5G). Ratios will be WIP

> **_NOTE:_** Flour ratio is WIP. I've seen anywhere from ~28-35 grams per egg. 28 was super "eggy", 35 was more like a popover (in a muffin tin)

| -------------- | ----: | ----------------------- | ---- |
| 1 Large        |   ~57 | Eggs                    | 100  |
| 100 ML         |  ~100 | whole or low-fat milk   | 175  |

| 1/2 Tablespoon |       | Lard \| Duck Fat \| Oil |      |

## Preparation

### Batter

> The batter _should_ be prepared the night before

1. Whisk the eggs and milk until combined
2. Add the flour and mix again. This should end up as a runny batter. 
3. Let rest for at least 30 minutes in the fridge, up to overnight.

### Cooking

> Speed is key when you add the batter, the oil should be as hot as possible.

1. Preheat oven to 425
2. Add approx 1/2 tablespoon of fat to each cup
3. pre-heat the tray so that the fat is really hot. You may not hit the smokepoint of lard or duck fat
4. Give the batter a good stir before pouring
5. Fill each tin to 3/4 full
6. Bake 15-20 minutes until golden brown



# Cooking Log

**2020-05-??:** Attempted "breakfast" yorkies with jam. One came out nicely, the rest leaked into the tin. Wasn't fun to clean.

**2020-05-17:** 5 eggs, 49%fl / 28gr per yorkie. Cooked in a cast iron pan, result was good. Didn't measure fat, but used _a lot_, which ended up flodding the middle. Was very eggy, Ox liked it that way. 

**2020-06-14:** 6 eggs, 32gr fl per yorkie. Cooked in a [proper yorkie tin](https://www.amazon.com/WIN-WARE-Non-Stick-Yorkshire-yorkshire-puddings/dp/B00GFUHB5G). Used enough duck fat to cover the bottom of each setting, enough batter to cover 2/3rds. This was way too much batter, and we got 12 before we gave up. One yorkie per tin came out perfectly, and the rest were pancakes.
