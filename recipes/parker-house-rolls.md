# Parker House Rolls

This is from the [King Arthur Baking Blog](https://www.kingarthurbaking.com/blog/2011/01/09/let-the-good-times-roll-parker-house-rolls)

# Ingredients

- 1 cup (227g) milk
- 1 large egg
- 3 cups (361g) unbleached AP flour
- 2½ teaspoons instant yeast
- 3 tablespoons (30g) sugar
- 1¼ teaspoons salt
- ¼ cup (50g) potato flour or ¾ cup (50 g) dried potato flakes
- 3 tablespoons (43g) **unsalted** butter (butter _A_)
- 3-4 tablespoons **unsalted** butter (butter B) ; 3 is just enough, 4 is generous

# Procedure

Total time = 3 hours with 90 minute first rise, 1 hour second rise, 25 minute bake

1. Whisk together milk & 1 large egg. **GENTLY** heat to about 100°F (just enough so it's not cold)
2. If using active dry yeast instead of the recommended instant, **bloom it now**
3. In mixing bowl: flour, yeast, sugar, salt, potato flour, butter _A_
4. Stir to combine, then knead. At first, the dough will seem clay-like, and appear rough. After 7 or 8 minutes, though, the dough should be nice and smooth.
5. Place in a lightly greased bowl or 8-cup measure and let rise for 90 minutes.
6. Lighly grease a 9" x 13" pan
7. Transfer to lightly greased work surface, divide in half.
8. Melt butter _B_ and brush on the dough.
9. One half at a time:
    1. Roll/pat into an 8" x 12" rectangle, brush with a light coating of butter
    2. Cut in half lengthwise to make two 4" x 12" rectangles
    3. One rectangle at a time, fold lengthwise to about ½" of the other edge, so the bottom edge sticks out
    4. Cut each rectangle crosswise into four 3" pieces to make 8 rolls
    5. Place smooth side up the pan, long side of roll going down long side of pan
10. At this point you have 16 rolls in a pan
11. Gently squish the rolls so they pretty much cover the bottom of the pan
12. Cover and let rise for 45 minutes to 1 hour -- puffy but _definitely_ not doubled. Towards the end, start preheating oven to 350°F
13. Bake 20-25 minutes until golden brown and feeling set
14. Remove from oven and turn out onto a rack, place the rack of rolls over a piece of parchment
15. Brush with remaining butter _B_, done!

# Selected comments

> If you'd like to prepare the Parker House Roll dough in advance, you can mix the dough, let it rest at room temperature for about 10 to 15 minutes and then put the dough in the fridge overnight. Complete the first rise (the bulk fermentation) in the fridge for about 12 to 16 hours (overnight). The next morning, go straight to shaping and buttering the dough. Let the dough rest until the rolls become puffy; this may take slightly longer than expected to account for the dough being cold. Go ahead and bake as directed in the recipe.
