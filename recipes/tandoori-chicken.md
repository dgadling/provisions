# Ingredients

## Masala
- 1 tablespoon cumin seeds
- 1 tablespoon coriander seeds
- 4 black cardamom pods
- 1/2 teaspoon black peppercorns
- 1 teaspoon fenugreek / mustard seeds
- 1/2 cinnamon stick

## Chicken
- 5 pounds legs/drumsticks/thighs/whatever
- salt
- 2 tablesppons Kashmiri chili powder
  - **NOTE**: We used 1 1/2 tablespoon smoked paprika + 1/2 tablespoon cayenne
- 1 lemon's juice
- 1/2 cup full-fat Greek yogurt
- 2-3 tablespoons ginger-garlic paste, prepacked or freshly peeled & grated
  - **NOTE** We used 1 1/2 tablespoons of each, from a tube
- 12 - 16 drops red food coloring (optional)

# Directions

## Masala
1. Toast everything on medium-high heat until fragrant and just smoking
2. Grind into a powder

## Chicken
1. Score chicken with several deep cuts each
2. Put chicken into a large glass/stainless steel bowl
3. Give a good coating of salt, followed by the masala (probably won't need all of it), followed by the ginger/garlic paste
4. Add lemon juice, yogurt, and optional food coloring
5. Mix well until everything is coated in an even paste.
6. Cover or put in a zip-top bag, and let marinate in the fridge for up to 24 hours

## Broiling (20 - 40 minutes)
1. Move oven racks to top-most and middle position, set oven to broil
2. Put all the chicken on a rack on a sheet pan
3. Broil for 5 minutes, rotate pan, broil an additional 5 minutes
4. Take pan out, flip pieces, repeat step 3
5. Check temp - you want at least 170 F.
6. If you need more temp, set the oven to 350-400 and move pan to middle rack. Check every 10 minutes or so.

## Grilling (35 - 45 minutes)
1. Full chimney, light, lay into your grill
2. Spread a heavy layer of fresh charcoal, lay grate over, open bottom vents all the way, let heat for 5 minutes.
3. Clean & grease grill grate, put on chicken and cover with lid vents half-open
4. After 5 minutes flip chicken, cover, leave alone for 30 - 40 minutes
5. Again, you want 170 F
