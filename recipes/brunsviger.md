# Ingredients
## Cake
* 240ml (1 cup) milk, room temperature
* 50g granulated sugar
* 1 tsp dry active yeast
* 1/2 teaspoon salt
* 1 tbsp ground cardamom
* 1 egg
* ½ teaspoon salt
* 420g strong white/bread/plain flour + ¼ cup for later
* 85g **unsalted** butter, melted
## Topping
* 200g dark brown sugar
* 160g **unsalted** butter
* 1 tbsp cinnamon

# Method
## Dough
1. In a bowl add the milk, sugar and yeast, leave to bloom for 5mins.
2. Add the egg and whisk well.
3. Mix the melted butter followed by the flour, salt and cardamom.
4. Mix to make a shaggy dough.
5. Turn over onto a floured surface and begin to knead. If too sticky add the extra flour. The dough should end up slightly tacky, not smooth.
6. Place in an oiled bowl and cover. Place in a dark warm place to **rise** for **1 hour** or until risen.
7. Turn over into a parchment paper lined deep oven dish. Make small indentations using your fingers (oiled) and then cover and leave to **rise** in a warm dark place for **another hour**.

## Topping
1. In a small saucepan on medium heat melt the remaining butter.
2. Add the sugar and cinnamon and mix.
3. Leave to simmer and then remove from heat.

## Cake
1. Preheat oven to 200c/390F
2. After the second rise, make indentations again using your fingers and the holes should resemble that of focaccia.
3. Pour the melted sugar mixture all over making sure it goes into the small holes.
4. Place in and cook for 25mins or until golden brown.
