# Ingredients
* 2 C AP flour (290 g, 10 oz)
* ¼ C granulated sugar (60 g, 2 oz)
* 4 tsp baking powder
* ¼ tsp baking soda
* ½ tsp salt
* 1 + ¾ C milk (440 ml)
* ¼ C butter (60g)
* ½ tsp vanilla
* 1 tsp pandan
* 1 large egg

# Instructions
1. Combine together the flour, sugar (or sweetener), baking powder, baking soda and salt in a large-sized bowl.
2. Make a well in the centre and add the milk, slightly cooled melted butter, vanilla and egg.
3. Use a wire whisk to whisk the wet ingredients together first before slowly folding them into the dry ingredients. Mix together until smooth (there may be a couple of lumps but that's okay).
    * The batter will be thick and creamy in consistency. If you find the batter too thick -- doesn't pour off the ladle or out of the measuring cup smoothly -- fold a couple tablespoons of extra milk into the batter at a time until reaching desired consistency
4. Set the batter aside and allow to rest while heating up your pan or griddle. 
5. Heat a nonstick pan or griddle over low-medium heat and wipe over with a little butter to lightly grease pan. Pour ¼ cup of batter onto the pan and spread out gently into a round shape with the back of your ladle or measuring cup.
6. When the underside is golden and bubbles begin to appear on the surface, flip with a spatula and cook until golden. Repeat with remaining batter.
7. Serve with honey, maple syrup, fruit, ice cream or frozen yoghurt, or enjoy plain!
