# Ingredients
- 2 cups all-purpose flour
- ⅓ cup sugar
- 1 teaspoon baking powder
- ¼ teaspoon baking soda
- 1/2 teaspoon salt
- 8 tablespoons unsalted butter (or butter replacement), frozen
- 1/2 cup raisins (or dried currants, cherries, etc)
- 1/2 cup sour cream, dairy or non-dairy
- 1 large egg

# Directions
Preheat oven to 400 degrees.
In a medium bowl, mix flour,
sugar, baking powder, baking soda, and salt.

Using a box grater, grate the frozen butter using the large grater side into the flour mixture.
Use your fingers to work in butter (mixture should resemble coarse meal), then stir in raisins.

In a small bowl, whisk sour cream and egg until smooth.

Using a fork, stir sour cream mixture into flour mixture until large dough clumps form.
Use your hands to press the dough against the bowl into a ball. The dough will be sticky to start.

Continue to work gently and the dough will come together.

Place on a lightly floured surface and pat into a 7- to 8-inch circle about 3/4-inch thick. Sprinkle with remaining I tsp. of
sugar.

Use a sharp knife to cut into 8 triangles; place on a cookie sheet (preferably AirBake, lined with parchment paper), about I
inch apart.

Bake until golden, about 15 to 17 minutes.

Cool for 5 minutes and serve warm or at room temperature.
