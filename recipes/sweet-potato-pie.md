From [Chef Billy Parisi](https://www.billyparisi.com/homemade-sweet-potato-pie-recipe-marshmallow-merengue/)

# Ingredients
## For the crust
- Frozen pie crust

## For the filling
- 3 large sweet potatoes, baked & peeled
- 1 cup brown sugar
- 3 eggs
- 5 tbsp unsalted butter
- ½ cup whole milk
- 1 tsp cinnamon
- ½ tsp nutmeg

## For the marshmallow merengue
- 3 egg whites
- ¼ tsp cream of tartar
- ¼ cup sugar
- one 8 oz jar of marshmallow whip

# Procedure
1. Wash potatoes and bake at 375°F for 60 minutes
2. Peel sweet potatoes and add them to a large bowl with the other ingredients and mix until combined
3. Pour the filling into the pie crust and bake for 60-65 minutes at 375°F. You wan the top & center to be firm.
4. While the pie is cooking make the merengue
    1. Add the egg whites, cream of tartar, and sugar to a stand mixer w/ whisk. Whisk on high speed until medium peaks, 3-4 minutes. Medium peaks = pull out whisk and it holds but the top peak folds over a bit.
    2. Add marshmallow whip and mix on _high_ speed until stiff peaks
5. When the pie is done cooking add the merengue on top in whatever style you like. Bake at 400°F for 10 minutes / until the merengue is browned
