Ingredients
===========
- 8 oz medium/large elbow macaroni
- ½ pounds bacon
- ½ stick salted butter
- ¼ cup all purpose flour
- ½ tsp ground mustard
- ½ tsp salt
- ⅙ tsp paprika
- ¼ tsp pepper
- 2½ cups half & half
- (Optional) 1.5 oz diced jalapeños
- 2 cups shredded cheddar cheese in a large bowl
- 1½ cups multi-cheese mix in a separate bowl

Tools
=====
- Collander
- Large pot for boiling macaroni
- Medium sauce pan
- Large mixing bowl
- 9" x 11" pan or all-edges or something similar, greased one way or another
- Two burners
- One oven
- Optionally one smoker

Directions
==========
1. Start heating the oven-ish-thing to 400 F. If you're using a separate smoker get it going at 225 F.
2. In a large pot par-cook boil the pasta according to the directions. Generally 8-10 minutes.
  1. You want it quite tough (al dente) still when you pull it out, it'll finish cooking later.
  2. Once it's done boiling rinse it with cold water until the pasta is cold to stop the cooking process.
3. Bake the bacon on a cookie sheet (or wire rack on cookie sheet) for about 15 minutes or until quite crunchy
4. With the pasta & bacon going you can do other things!
5. In a medium sauce pot on medium heat:
  1. Melt the butter
  2. Add the flour, mustard, salt, pepper, and paprika. Stir until well mixed
  3. Add the half & half and cook until thickened, about 8-10 minutes. It helps to use a whisk to help it thicken.
  4. **NOTE**: You can leave this at any point if you need, to pull the bacon and crumble it, just turn the heat down to low and don't dawdle
6. At some point pull the bacon out, soak up excess grease with a paper towel, and crumble.
  1. If you're not smoking, but regular baking, set the oven to 350 F.
5. Pour this sauce over the cheddar and stir until the cheddar is nicely melted and everything is thick and smooth.
  1. **NOTE**: This is another place where you can pull the bacon and start crumbling it, this sauce can sit for a while.
6. Mix the noodles, crumbled bacon, and optional jalapeños into the cheese mix
7. Pour everything into the baking pan
8. Ready, set, bake!
  1. If traditionally baking, bake at 350 F for about an hour
  2. If smoking, smoke at 225 F for 2-3 hours
9. 🎉 🎉 🎉
